## Abstract
This study enhances an existing global hydrology model, Xanthos, by adding a new water management module, treating irrigation, hydropower, and flood-control reservoirs differently. We determine a unique operation rule for each of 3790 large reservoirs globally based on their primary purposes, i.e., hydropower, irrigation, flood-control or others. We apply the enhanced Xanthos globally at a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. The model performance is satisfactory in reproducing observed streamflow variability under normal and water scarcity conditions at 91 large river basins with good data availability. Hydropower reservoirs' simulated storage and release patterns are quite different from flood-control reservoirs, suggesting significant implications for freshwater resources management at the regional or larger scales. This new global water management modeling framework will allow for the assessment of future reservoir development and management from a coupled human-natural system perspective.

## Code reference
References for each minted software release for all code involved.  

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub user name.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.

### Input data
Reference for each minted data source for your input data.  For example:

- **Forcing Data**
In the study, we used gridded climatic data from the WATer and global CHange (WATCH; Weedon et al., 2011) dataset from 1971 to 2001. The global monthly datasets include precipitation, maximum temperature, relative humidity and minimum temperature.
