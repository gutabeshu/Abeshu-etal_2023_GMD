## Abstract
This study enhances an existing global hydrology model, Xanthos, by adding a new water management module, treating irrigation, hydropower, and flood-control reservoirs differently. We determine a unique operation rule for each of 3790 large reservoirs globally based on their primary purposes, i.e., hydropower, irrigation, flood-control or others. We apply the enhanced Xanthos globally at a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. The model performance is satisfactory in reproducing observed stream flow variability under normal and water scarcity conditions at 91 large river basins with good data availability. Hydropower reservoirs' simulated storage and release patterns are quite different from flood-control reservoirs, suggesting significant implications for freshwater resource management at the regional or larger scales. This new global water management modeling framework will allow for the assessment of future reservoir development and management from a coupled human-natural system perspective.

## Data reference

### Input data
The following are input data required to run the model

- **Forcing Data:**
In the study, we used gridded climatic data from the WATer and global CHange (WATCH; Weedon et al., 2011) dataset from 1971 to 2001. The global monthly datasets include precipitation, maximum temperature, relative humidity and minimum temperature. DataHub: https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/input-data-bias-adjustment/details/3/

- **Water demand and water use data:**
Monthly water demand and consumptive water use data for various sectors at a 0.5-degree resolution are from Huang et al. (2018), which are available from 1971 to 2010. DataHub: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1209296

- **Reservoirs Data:**
Global reservoir data are obtained from the GRanD dataset (Lehner et al., 2011). The GRanD database we use here only considers reservoirs with storage capacity values greater than 0.1 km3. Reservoirs with missing storage capacity and those identified with purposes such as tide control are dropped, reducing the total GranD reservoirs from 6862 to 6847. DataHub: https://doi.org/10.7927/H4HH6H08

- **Streamflow Data:**
Observed stream flow data for model parameter identification and validation are obtained from the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC)DataHub: https://www.bafg.de/GRDC

### Output data

## Contributing modeling software
| Model | Version | Repository Link | DOI |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Xanthos | version |https://github.com/gutabeshu/xanthos-wm steps for installation can be found at  https://github.com/JGCRI/xanthos | https://doi.10.5281/zenodo.5177210  |


## Reproduce my experiment

1. Get xanthos-wm from https://github.com/gutabeshu/xanthos-wm
2. Install the software components required to conduct the experiment from [Contributing modeling software](#contributing-modeling-software)
3. Download the supporting input data required to conduct the experiment from https://doi.org/10.5072/zenodo.1075813. Place it in the 'xanthos-wm' folder and unzip.
4. Under xanthos-wm find 'pm_abcd_mrtm_managed.ini' and date the following as needed:
   - 'basin_list = 229, 230, 231':provide list of IDs of basins you would like to run (IDs of CONUS basins are 7, 217 - 226, 228, 230, 233)
   - 'set_calibrate=1': If the basin is in CONUS this will automatically perform both the Stage-1 and Stage-2 calibration process shown below
        <p align="center"> <img src="workflow/Figure-3-Runoff Parameters Selection Strategy.png"></p>

4. After the run is complete the calibration process and model output can be found under 'xanthos-wm/example/output'
5. Run the following scripts in the `workflow` directory to re-create this experiment:

| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| ---  | --- | --- |
| `Figure-X.py` | Script to compare my outputs to the original | edit the `dir_in` at the beginning to your output directory|

***File Modification***\
Check each file listed in [Table 5](#table5) and modify every directory within those files to the directory that holds your data.
<a name="table5"></a>
**Table 5:** Files to be modified to run the model.

| Model | Programming Language | Files to be Modified |
|---|:-:|---|
| Xanthos | Python 3.3+ | xanthos-wm/:  **pm_abcd_mrtm_managed.ini**|
